# Bike-Trip-DashBoard
Using the BikeTrip Dataset from Google BigQuery (bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare), I created a Power BI Dashboard to compare &amp; analyse different aspects of the information provided in the dataset. This analysis allowed me to refine the data and create a Power BI dashboard that makes the general public's understanding of the data easier.
